The EUMETNET postprocessing (PP) module has just published its first dataset paper to date in `Earth System Science Data <https://www.earth-system-science-data.net/>`_.

This paper is about EUPPBench, the first version of an open postprocessing benchmark dataset which can be used in many different ways by the scientific community to benchmark new and old postprocessing methods. This dataset and the description article are the result of the hard work of the many module participants.

The dataset includes both gridded and station-point ECMWF forecasts along with the observations, time-paired together to obtain an 'analysis-ready dataset' that can be used directly by the statistical and machine learning community.
