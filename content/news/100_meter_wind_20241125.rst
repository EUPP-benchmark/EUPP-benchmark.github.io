:summary: 100 meters wind gridded observations get added to the base and the EUPPBench datasets, allowing to investigate postprocessing for the renewables, in particular over the North Sea.

Thanks to the efforts of Joris Van den Bergh and Ruoke Meng from the `Royal Meteorological Institute of Belgium <https://www.meteo.be>`_, 100 meters *u* and *v* wind fields gridded observations
have been added to the `base dataset <{filename}../pages/datasets.rst#base>`_ and the `EUPPBench dataset <{filename}../pages/datasets.rst#eupp>`_.

Indeed, these gridded observations were not provided with the first version of the dataset, while they are certainly useful for the postprocessing of
variables important for the renewable energy production, especially for the wind farms lying in the North Sea.

As for the rest of the dataset, the provided gridded observations are based on the `ERA5 gridded reanalysis <https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5>`_.
These fields are already available online, and will be available in the next release of the dataset on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_.

See below an example of what can be plotted with these new data:
