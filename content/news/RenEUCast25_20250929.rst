It is our great pleasure to announce the RenEUCast scientific Workshop taking place 8-10 December 2025 in Brussels.
This event will bring together experts from different fields and backgrounds for the exchange of knowledge and experiences focused on forecasting for the renewable energy sector.
The central theme of this event is providing useful forecasts and nowcasts to European renewable energy stakeholders, who are also invited to the workshop, and to foster a better understanding of how end users make use of forecasts and nowcasts in their decision making.

This event, held at the `Vrije Universteit <https://www.vub.be/en>`_ Brussel, is supported and funded by the European Meteorological Network SNC (`EUMETNET <https://www.eumetnet.eu/>`_) and the Belgian Science Policy Office (`Belspo <https://www.belspo.be/>`_).
